# Bug Bounty Guidelines

This is just a guidelines for companies on how to reward submissions based on its severity.

For startup companies (referred to as “Startups”), we recommend a minimum of $100 for low severity vulnerabilities.

| Severity | **Startups** | **SMEs** | **Corporations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low | $100 | $300 | $500 |
| Medium | $300 | $500 | $750 |
| High | $500 | $750 | $1,000 |
| Critical | $1,000 | $1,500 | $2,000 |

Please note that you can award any bounty you want but the it must be bigger than the default bounty depending on the severity.
